Day-2 notes

types of SDLC(software development life cycle)

1️⃣ Waterfall Model
      Linear and sequential. One phase must finish before the next starts.
2️⃣ Agile Model
      Incremental development with frequent feedback and changes.
3️⃣ Scrum Model (Agile framework)
      Work done in short sprints with daily meetings.
4️⃣ Iterative Model
      Develop software in repeated cycles, improving each version.
5️⃣ Incremental Model
      Build the system in small functional parts (increments).
6️⃣ V-Model (Verification & Validation)
      Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.
7️⃣ Spiral Model
      Risk-driven model with repeated planning and evaluation.
8️⃣ Prototype Model
      Build a quick prototype to clarify requirements before final development.
9️⃣ Big Bang Model
      Minimal planning, mostly used for small or experimental projects.
1️⃣0️⃣ RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model
      Fast development using reusable components and tools.

SDLC steps (simple)
1 -> Requirement Gathering & Analysis ← 👉 this is your step
2 -> System Design
3 -> Development (Coding)
4 -> Testing
5 -> Deployment
6 -> Maintenance

UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams:
1 -> Class diagram 
      class
      variables
      methods
      relationships (inheritance, association, composition)

2 -> Use Case Diagram

Shows user interactions
    Actors (User, Admin)
    Use cases (Login, Register, Book Appointment)

Used for:
  Requirement understanding

3 -> Sequence Diagram
      Shows method call flow over time

Contains:
  Objects
  Messages (method calls)

Used for:
    Explaining API flow, backend logic
    
    Example:
      User → Controller → Service → Repository → DB

4 -> Activity Diagram

Shows workflow or logic flow

Contains:

Actions
Decisions
Start / End

Used for:
    Business logic, algorithms

5 -> State Diagram
    Shows state changes

Used for:
    Order status, payment status, ticket lifecycle

Example:
    Created → Paid → Shipped → Delivered

6 -> Component Diagram
  Shows system modules

Used for:
    Microservices, high-level design

Example:
    Frontend → Auth Service → Order Service → DB

7 -> Deployment Diagram

    Shows physical deployment

Used for:
    Cloud, servers, Docker, Kubernetes
