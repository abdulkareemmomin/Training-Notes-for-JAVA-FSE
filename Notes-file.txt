Day 2 — SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) & UML
----------------------------------------------------

1. SDLC Models (short descriptions)
   1) Waterfall Model
      - Linear and sequential. Each phase must finish before the next starts.
   2) Agile Model
      - Incremental development with frequent feedback and changes.
   3) Scrum (an Agile framework)
      - Work in short sprints with daily stand-ups and sprint reviews.
   4) Iterative Model
      - Develop software in repeated cycles, improving each version.
   5) Incremental Model
      - Build the system in small functional parts (increments).
   6) V-Model (Verification & Validation)
      - Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.
   7) Spiral Model
      - Risk-driven model with repeated planning and evaluation.
   8) Prototype Model
      - Build a quick prototype to clarify requirements before final development.
   9) Big Bang Model
      - Minimal planning; used for small or experimental projects.
   10) RAD (Rapid Application Development)
      - Fast development using reusable components and tools.

2. SDLC Steps (simple)
   1 -> Requirement Gathering & Analysis  ← this is your step
   2 -> System Design
   3 -> Development (Coding)
   4 -> Testing
   5 -> Deployment
   6 -> Maintenance

3. UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams
   - Purpose: Visualize, specify, construct and document software systems.

   1) Class Diagram
      - Shows: classes, attributes (variables), methods (operations), and relationships
                (inheritance, association, composition, aggregation).
      - Used for: Static design of the system and object structure.

   2) Use Case Diagram
      - Shows: actors (users, external systems) and use cases (functionalities).
      - Used for: Capturing functional requirements and user interactions.
      - Example actors: User, Admin
      - Example use cases: Login, Register, Book Appointment

   3) Sequence Diagram
      - Shows: interactions between objects arranged in time sequence.
      - Contains: objects (lifelines) and messages (method calls).
      - Used for: Explaining API flow and backend logic.
      - Example flow: User → Controller → Service → Repository → DB

   4) Activity Diagram
      - Shows: workflow or logic flow (actions, decisions, start/end points).
      - Used for: Business logic, algorithms, and process flows.

   5) State Diagram (State Machine)
      - Shows: states of an entity and transitions between states.
      - Used for: Modeling lifecycle of objects (e.g., orders, payments).
      - Example: Created → Paid → Shipped → Delivered

   6) Component Diagram
      - Shows: high-level system modules and their dependencies.
      - Used for: Microservices and modular design.
      - Example: Frontend → Auth Service → Order Service → Database

   7) Deployment Diagram
      - Shows: physical deployment of software on hardware nodes.
      - Used for: Cloud architecture, servers, Docker containers, Kubernetes.

Notes / Tips
-----------
- Use diagrams to communicate different aspects: structure (class/component), behavior (sequence/activity/state), and deployment (deployment diagram).
- Start with requirements and use cases to drive high-level design; then refine into class diagrams and sequence diagrams for implementation details.
- Choose an SDLC model based on project complexity, risk, and need for change: Agile for frequent change and collaboration, Waterfall for well-understood requirements.
